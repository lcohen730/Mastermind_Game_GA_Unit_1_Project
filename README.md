# Mastermind
**Unit 1 Solo Project for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive**

Mastermind is a game of logic where the user is trying to guess a secret code in a certain number of guesses.
After every guess, the user is given hints for every correct guess made, and can use those hints to make more informed future guesses.

The game of Mastermind is based on an older game called Bulls and Cows that dates back to at least the 19th century.

The modern board game of Mastermind was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.

I hope you enjoy this online version of the classic game.
