        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Guess a combination of colors by clicking on the colors in the order you want your guess.</li>
            <li>The game will fill in empty peg slots with a [black] peg for the amount of colors you guessed correct color and correct location and a [red] peg for amount of colors you guessed correct color but wrong location.</li>
            <li>Using logic, determine what to guess next and make your next several guesses (up to 9) to figure out what the secret code of colors is.</li>
            <li>If you guess the secret code in 9 moves or less, you win! If not, you lose.</li>
